# Propel Orm

Propel is an open-source Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for SQL-Databases in PHP 5.5. It allows you to access your database using a set of objects, providing a simple API for storing and retrieving data.

I create a simple example.

For run first created a database with the name `bookstore`, after run make:

```bash
composer install
```

For install all dependencies of propel orm, after instated the dependencies, run

```
make propel model
```

And done, is prepared for work
